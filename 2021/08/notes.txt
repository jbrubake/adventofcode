Algorithm:
- the segment that differs between 1 and 7 MUST = a
    d = A
- the 2-seg # MUST = cf
    ab = 1 = cf
- the 4-seg # will have 2 segs left which MUST = bd
    ef = 2 = bd
- there will be a 5-seg # with 1 seg left which MUST = g, the # MUST = 5 and the 1 MUST = f
    c = G
    b = 1 = F
- this makes the other 1 = C
    a = 1 = C
- the unmarked # in the 8 (6-segs) MUST = e
    g = E
- there will be 2 5-seg #s with a single 2 which MUST = d
    f = 2 = D
- the other 2 MUST = b
    e = 2 = B
